This is a study to see how well the Opus audio codec works on a iPhone.

The opus code itself has purposely been left out. It can be downloaded from http://www.opus-codec.org/downloads/

Build Instructions
===========

1. Get the opus source code
2. Link it to the directory 'source' at the top level of this project
3. Build using XCode

The opus library .xcodeproj was created using gyp and the opus.gyp file extracted from the WebRTC open source project.
